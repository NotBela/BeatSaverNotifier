# BeatSaverNotifier

BeatSaverNotifier is a BSIPA mod that aims to provide an easy way to download maps uploaded to BeatSaver by mappers that they follow.

> [!NOTE]
> BeatSaverNotifier requires a BeatSaver account to function.

# Installation
Simply drag the mod into your 'Plugins' folder in your game install. In addition to BSIPA, this mod also requires BSML and SiraUtil.

# Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must follow at least one person in order for the mod to function properly, otherwise the mod will pull the most recently uploaded maps by anyone.

In order to use BeatSaverNotifier, you first need to sign in with BeatSaver in the 'Mod Settings' menu. Simply click the 'Login with BeatSaver' button and follow the prompts in the web browser window that opens on the desktop. Then press the 'OK' button ingame, and the BeatSaverNotifier menu button should be interactable ingame. It may take a while for someone to upload a map, since the mod only shows maps that are uploaded after the mod's first check date. If you have a map in queue, the menu button will become green and the text will be bold.
